# Python Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the Python Data Structures Tutorial! Here, we will be reviewing 3 different data structures you may encounter while programming in Python. They are:

- [Queues](1-queues.md)
- [Linked-Lists]
- [Trees]

Each module will contain a description of the data structure, an example of how you may use the data structure in Python, and a problem you must complete individually. This problem is meant to test your understanding of the data structure. A link to the solution will be provided, but it is encouraged that you attempt to complete the problem before viewing it.
