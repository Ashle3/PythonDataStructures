# Trees

## Introduction

Here, I will give a brief explanation of how trees are different from linked lists. I might compare how a linked list is like a group of friends keeping in touch, and a tree is like a family tree. 

## Binary Tree

Here, I will go over the key terms of a basic binary tree. I will define what a binary tree is (a family tree that doesn't list the spouses, and each family has only two children). I will also define these terms and display them in an image:
- Node
- Root
- Leaf
- Parent
- Child
- Subtree

## Binary Search Tree

Define what a Binary Search Tree is (state how there are rules to inserting into a binary search tree; lower goes on the left, higher goes on the right).

Will also have a diagram displaying this.

## Balanced vs Unbalanced Binary Search Tree

I will explain and show how a bst can become unbalanced. 

I will briefly explain how AVL can balance a tree.

## How to create an empty BST in python

Similar to how I walked through the LinkedList class in the previous tutorial, I will walk through how to create an empty bst, and how to create a new node.

## Insert into a BST

I will then go over how to insert a node into a bst, based on its value.

## I will also go over how to print out the items in a bst

For my example problem, I will enter items from a sorted list, into a bst

For the practice problem, the student will have to create their own function that inserts items from a sorted list into a bst.
